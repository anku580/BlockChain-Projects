# BlockChain-Projects
This is basically my blockchain projects till now I have made while learning the blockchain.

# There are three projects as of now-

* ## 1. Private Blockchain
The first project is the private blockchain which defines how the blocks are created in the blockchain and what parameters are there
in the blockchain.

* ## 2. RESTFUL Web API Node.js Framework
In this project a user is able to create a block and view the block using the endpoints created.

* ## 3. Private Blockchain Star Notary Service
It is the third project in which a user can own a star using the endpoints in the project.
